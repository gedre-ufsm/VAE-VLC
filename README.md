# Vae-GAN
Vae-GAN used to learn VLC channels with IQ complex dataset.

This code runs in Jupyter notebook v2024.4.0 with VSCode v1.89.1.

Need the files 'sent_data_complex.npy', 'received_data_complex.npy' and 'lenna.png'.

To use with GPU, you need to match the versions of Tensorflow, Python, cuDNN and CUDA. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
