Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for learning VLC channels with IQ complex dataset.

This code runs in Jupyter notebook v2024.4.0 with VSCode v1.89.1.

Need the files 'sent_data_tuple.npy', 'received_data_tuple_sync-phase.npy'

To use with GPU, you need to match the versions of Tensorflow, Python, cuDNN and CUDA. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu

The point is to replicate the VLC channel behavior. The EVM and the constellation are the metrics.
